Psuedo-code
1. Get suspicious url
2. Check if the history exists beyond when this tab was opened.
3. Search for similar urls in the history older than the tab being scrutinized.
	chrome.history.getVisits(chrome.history.search(object query, function callback))
4. If similar urls not found, throw up an under suspicion warning.
5. If similar urls found, get id of and take screenshot of the current tab. (or html?)
	Several options for doing this...
	chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab(integer windowId, object options, function callback) saves as png
	chrome.pageCapture.saveAsMHTML(object details, function callback) saves as mhtml
6. Save mhtml or png screenshot of similar urls and place in an image array of a size determined by number of results.
7. Compare for equality.
