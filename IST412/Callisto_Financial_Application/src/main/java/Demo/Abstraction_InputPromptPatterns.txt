ABSTRACTION & INPUT PROMPT DESIGN PATTERNS (Albana Beqo)
The Person class is created as an abstract class.
Customer and Employee classes extend Person.
Input Prompt has been included in the customer login page
The username and the password text field include a prompt respectively. 
(I understand that this is not a very useful practice here, however, we don't have many UI screens
at this point, so this UI is the only one that I could use to demonstrate the Input Prompt pattern).
